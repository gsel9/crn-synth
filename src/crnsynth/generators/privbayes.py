    PrivBayes implementation of synthetic-data-generation library (DK). Other implementations can be found in synthcity
    or DataSynthesizer. However, these only concern the base version of the original PrivBayes paper.

    This version also implemented the following improvements mentioned in the extended paper:
    - R score function instead of Mutual Information - which has a lower sensitivity and thus requires less noise to compute.
    - Candidate attribute-parent pairs (AP-pairs) are determined based on the theta-usefulness criterion instead of setting a fixed max degree K.
